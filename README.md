# Refactoring Existing Code

For this particular Challenge, a mock marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
## Project Summary

## Project Link

https://nayonnapurnell.github.io/HTML-CSS-GIT-HW-1/


### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Mock-Up

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Note: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, you may notice that some of the elements don't look exactly like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.](./assets/images/hero-image.png)
