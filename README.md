# Refactoring Existing Code

A marketing agency, The Horiseon Company has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
This refactored website should be compliant with mandatory accessibility requirements and should incorporate best practices for code maintenance and readability.
## Project Summary

The following tasks completed to follow the User Story's acceptance criteria:
* HTML and CSS were updated to be in line with best practices, in a consolidated, logical sequence
* HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
* Alt text was added to images
* Fixed broken internal links
* Explanatory comments were provided in the HTML and CSS document



### User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
